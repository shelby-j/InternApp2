This is the second application I am making for my SecurityPS internship

It is a web application that uses, REST API, JavaScript, and AJAX to retrieve and modify data from the browser, and uses JWT tokens 
instead of cookies to track sessions and authorization. 

My app is called Inside Pitch and is for buying and selling softball and baseball equipment. A user can register as a buyer or a seller,
and can either purchase or list items depending on their role. There is also an admin role that has access to user data.
